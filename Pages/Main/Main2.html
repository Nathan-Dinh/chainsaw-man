                Denji is a young man trapped in poverty, working off his
                deceased father's debt to the yakuza by working as a Devil
                Hunter, aided by Pochita, his canine companion and Chainsaw
                Devil. Denji is betrayed by the yakuza, who kill him for a
                contract with the Zombie Devil. Pochita makes a contract with
                Denji, merging with him as a human-devil Hybrid, under the
                condition that Denji shows his dreams to Pochita. Denji
                massacres the yakuza, and is approached by a team of
                governmental Devil Hunters, the Public Safety Division, led by
                Makima, who persuades him to join their ranks. Agreeing, Denji
                is partnered with Power, the Blood Fiend, and Aki Hayakawa, a
                self-destructive Devil Hunter. Makima promises Denji any favor,
                provided he kill the Gun Devil, perpetrator of the greatest
                massacre in human history.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                Several missions later, Denji's group encounters another hybrid,
                the Katana Man, a vengeful yakuza seemingly allied with the Gun
                Devil, attacks the Division. Makima and devil hunter Kobeni
                Higashiyama managed to repel the yakuza, but they lost a great
                portion of the Division, including Aki's partner Himeno. In
                order to match them, Denji and Power are trained by Kishibe, a
                master Devil-hunter who distrusts Makima; Aki makes a deal with
                the Future Devil, who foresees a "horrible death" for him. The
                Division launches a counter-attack against the Katana Man,
                capturing him. Some time later, Denji meets and begins a romance
                with a woman named Reze, who is actually the Bomb Devil, a
                Hybrid spy for the Soviet Union, sent to capture him. Though
                returning his affection, she attacks the city, with the Division
                barely saving Denji. After recovering, Denji fights her, and
                accepts a proposal to leave Japan together; before they can
                reunite, Makima secretly captures her, though her true
                motivation remains unknown. Denji's fight with Bomb Devil
                reveals his existence to the world.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Foreign assassin groups target Denji: Chinese hunter and
                Kishibe's former partner, Quanxi; a mysterious enemy of Makima
                called "Santa Claus"; three American brothers; and a Russian
                woman teaching a pupil, Tolka. Denji is outfitted with a
                security detail including Hirofumi Yoshida, a Private Sector
                Devil Hunter contracting the Octopus Devil. Though the brothers
                are repelled, and Quanxi initially stalls, Santa Claus uses
                their Doll Devil powers for a large horde attack. After a
                follow-up by Quanxi, Tolka's master reveals herself as the true
                "Santa Claus", and has all parties transported to Hell, where
                they are attacked by the Darkness Devil. Santa Claus makes a
                contract with the Darkness Devil that empowers her. Makima
                retrieves the group from Hell, and Quanxi (who is revealed to be
                a hybrid) helps Denji defeat Santa Claus; Makima dispatches her
                afterwards. Following the incident, several devil hunters
                resigns, including Kobeni.

              <br />
              <p>
                After Denji recovers, Makima reveals the Gun Devil is actually a
                geopolitical asset, with many factions controlling pieces of it.
                As Aki begs Makima for Denji's safety, the president of the
                United States orders the Gun Devil to attack Japan and kill
                Makima. Revealed to be the Control Devil, Makima confronts the
                Gun Devil and wins. Aki dies in the attack, and the Gun Devil
                takes his body as a Fiend. Denji is attacked by the Gun Fiend,
                and, helped by civilians, kills it; Aki's death devastates him.
                While seemingly consoling him, Makima kills Power, revealing
                herself responsible for Denji's losses, having plotted to void
                his contract with Pochita by crushing his dreams of a normal
                life.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Kishibe attacks her, and she calls for "Chainsaw Man" to save
                her. Controlling Denji's body, Pochita assumes his true form and
                runs, taking Kobeni with him. Makima explains her goals: to use
                Pochita's power to eliminate concepts from reality to create a
                world without suffering; to this end, she was empowered by the
                government with immortality. Fighting the Chainsaw Man using the
                brainwashed Hybrids, which include Katana Man, Reze, and Quanxi,
                she wins, as Denji's heroic deeds have weakened Pochita who
                saves Kobeni. However, Power revives as the Blood Devil from a
                remnant of her blood from Denji, escapes with Chainsaw Man, and,
                mortally wounded, restores Denji's will to live, having him
                promise to find her when she is reborn in Hell.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Invigorated by public support for him, Denji confronts Makima
                for one last time and defeats her; to bypass her immortality, he
                eats her body. Later, Kishibe reveals the Control Devil
                resurfaced in the form of a little girl, now named Nayuta. He
                asks Denji to look after her, and Pochita supports this mission
                in Denji's dreams. Later, Denji enrolls in high school and
                continues fighting devils under the public eye.

              Tatsuki Fujimoto (藤本 タツキ born October 10, 1993) is a
              currently active mangaka best known for Fire Punch and Chainsaw
              Man. Fujimoto's works are noted for referencing his love of
              movies, a distinctively "scratchy" artstyle with high levels of
              detail, and writing rich worlds with distinctive characters.
              They're also well-known for having a commonality of existential
              dread and nihilistic despair... and yet a surprising amount of
              hope when faced against such overwhelming odds and sadness.
