                    Asa Mitaka is an introverted high school student attending Fourth East High School, who has trouble finding her place in society following her mother's death to the Typhoon Devil. One day, after accidentally killing her class' pet devil Bucky, she is confronted by a student who has made a contract with the Justice Devil. The student attempts to kill Asa, but Yoru the War Devil appears and makes a contract with Asa, inhabting her body and making her a living Fiend host, under the condition that she kills Chainsaw Man. After dispatching her killer, Asa seeks to find Chainsaw Man, though she and Yoru have differing goals: Asa wants Yoru to leave her body, while Yoru wants to reclaim the Nuclear Weapons Devil which was consumed by Pochita. They join the school's Devil Hunter Club, where they are partnered with Yoshida and Yuko, an outgoing student who becomes friends with her.

                <p>
                  Meanwhile, Denji has adapted to his new life as a normal high school student, also attending Fourth East, while using his newfound fame as Chainsaw Man to attract women. Yoshida keeps tabs on him under an unknown mission. Knowing that Denji is desperate for a girlfriend, Yoshida introduces Denji to Asa, who attempts to reveal to her that he is Chainsaw Man, but fails.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Asa later discovers that Yuko formed a contract with the Justice Devil and plans on enacting revenge on everyone who bullied Asa. Using Yoru's devil abilities, Asa confronts her, but accidentally slices Yuko into several pieces. At that moment, "Yoru's sister" appears and revives Yuko, turning her into a giant devil rampaging through the school. Denji attacks devil Yuko, but she escapes. The now-disfigured Yuko bids farewell to Asa and goes on the run for help, but a mysterious second Chainsaw Man dispatches her.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                 Following the incident, Asa and Yoru meets Haruka Iseumi, the President of both the Devil Hunter's Club and the student council, who has taken interest in her. "Yoru's sister" also reveals herself to be the Famine Devil named Fami who's also a devil hunter club member. Haruka tells Yoru that he is Chainsaw Man, showing her a starting cord attached to his chest as proof. Seemingly convinced, Asa starts a relationship with Denji in hopes of using him as a weapon against Chainsaw Man, unaware of his true nature.

            <p>
              Tatsuki Fujimoto (藤本 タツキ born October 10, 1993) is a
              currently active mangaka best known for Fire Punch and Chainsaw
              Man. Fujimoto's works are noted for referencing his love of
              movies, a distinctively "scratchy" artstyle with high levels of
              detail, and writing rich worlds with distinctive characters.
              They're also well-known for having a commonality of existential
              dread and nihilistic despair... and yet a surprising amount of
              hope when faced against such overwhelming odds and sadness.
