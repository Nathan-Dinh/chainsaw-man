                Chainsaw Man (Japanese: チェンソーマン, Hepburn: Chensō Man) is
                a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuki
                Fujimoto. Its first part was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen
                manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2018 to December
                2020; its second part began serialization in Shueisha's Shōnen
                Jump+ online magazine in July 2022. Its chapters have been
                collected in 12 tankōbon volumes as of October 2022. Chainsaw
                Man follows the story of Denji, an impoverished young man who
                makes a contract that fuses his body with that of a dog-like
                devil named Pochita, granting him the ability to transform parts
                of his body into chainsaws. Denji eventually joins the Public
                Safety Devil Hunters, a government agency focused on fighting
                against devils whenever they become a threat to Japan. The
                second arc of the story focuses on Asa Mitaka, a high school
                student who goes in a contract with Yoru the War Devil, who
                forces her to hunt down Chainsaw Man in order to reclaim the
                devils stolen from her. In North America, the manga is licensed
                in English by Viz Media, for both print and digital release, and
                it is also published by Shueisha on the Manga Plus online
                platform. An anime television series adaptation produced by
                MAPPA premiered in October 2022. As of November 2022, the manga
                had over 20 million copies in circulation, making it one of the
                best-selling manga series. In 2021, it won the 66th Shogakukan
                Manga Award in the shōnen category and won the Harvey Awards in
                the Best Manga category in 2021 and 2022. Chainsaw Man has been
                overall well received by critics, who have commended its
                storytelling, characters, dark humor and have particularly
                highlighted its violent scenes within the context of the story.
              </p>
              <h1>Setting</h1>
              <p>
                The story is set in a world where Devils (悪魔, Akuma) are born
                from human fears. Devils are usually dangerous and malevolent,
                their power is proportional to the fear they incite. However,
                humans can form contracts with them to use their power, and
                there are individuals specializing in hunting and employing
                them, called Devil Hunters (デビルハンター, Debiru Hantā).
                Devils originate from Hell, and exist in a cycle between Earth
                and Hell: they migrate to Earth when killed in Hell, and vice
                versa. Dwelling in Hell are extremely powerful Devils called
                Primal Fears, which have never been killed. Transit between
                planes appears to be overseen by the Hell Devil (地獄の悪魔,
                Jigoku no Akuma). A Devil may, in certain conditions, inhabit
                the body of a dead human, gaining some of their memories and
                personality; such a creature is called a Fiend (魔人, Majin,
                lit. Demonic Person). In rare cases, a living Fiend Host is
                possible where the dead human is able to retain their
                personality and balance control of the body with their
                inhabitant, who they are able to directly converse with. Devils
                who naturally have a humanoid form are said to be benevolent to
                humans. The events of the story take place in 1997, in an
                alternate timeline where the Soviet Union still exists, and many
                events such as the Holocaust, AIDS and nuclear weapons are
                revealed to have been erased from history and have ceased to
                exist entirely due to the consumption of their respective Devils
                by the Chainsaw Devil, with only a powerful group of devils
                known as the Four Horsemen remembering the original events.
                Likewise, there has been no war since the First World War as the
                War Devil has been weakened to the point that the only traces of
                war exist in pop culture and media.

              <h1>Production</h1>
              <p>
                Despite the series' violence and dark humor, Tatsuki Fujimoto
                always wanted to serialize in Weekly Shōnen Jump, but he had the
                feeling that his work would be "buried" if he had made a
                "Jump-like manga", so he tried to retain much of his
                individuality as a creator while making only the structure and
                characters Jump-like. Fujimoto also said that, despite its
                success in the magazine, he wanted to write the second part of
                the series on Shōnen Jump+, because he wanted to do a completely
                different series from the first part. According to him, there is
                not much of a difference in working between Weekly Shōnen Jump
                and Shōnen Jump+, explaining that there were a few depictions
                that got stopped during the rough draft stage, but he was
                allowed to do anything he wanted regarding the logic of the
                story.[5] Fujimoto said that he took inspiration from various
                works. During the serialization of Chainsaw Man, Fujimoto said
                that he was too busy, but he watched as many new things as he
                could and borrowed various elements from what he saw.[5] On
                Twitter, he stated that he was a fan of the 2016 film trilogy
                Kizumonogatari, and that the trilogy's final battle, shown in
                Part 3: Reiketsu, inspired the final battle of the first part of
                Chainsaw Man.[6] He also described the series as a "wicked FLCL"
                and a "pop Abara."[7] Fujimoto had various elements from the
                series planned from the beginning, while other things were added
                as it progressed. He did not have specific plans to bring payoff
                to the meaningful-sounding words and things that felt "off",
                adding that he left various things vague to make the series'
                second part easier to do.[5] Regarding the anime adaptation of
                the series, Fujimoto stated that he talked to the people
                handling it and he was comfortable leaving things to them.[5]
                When the anime series was officially announced, Fujimoto
                commented: "Chainsaw Man is like a copycat of Dorohedoro and
                Jujutsu Kaisen, and the studio of Dorohedoro and Jujutsu Kaisen
                will produce its anime!? I have nothing to say! Please do
                it!"[8] According to the manga's editor, Shihei Lin, Fujimoto is
                heavily involved in the production of the anime series, stating:
                "Fujimoto-san has seen all the Chainsaw Man's pitch documents,
                story structure, scripts, and even the storyboards. He has
                continued to be in close contact with MAPPA's anime team." MAPPA
                producer, Makoto Kimura, also commented that Fujimoto
                involvement extended to the casting, planning, and music,
                because the staff wanted the anime to capture as much of the
                manga's original vision as possible, including the violence and
                gore. MAPPA approached Shueisha with the pitch for the
                project.[9]

            <p>
              Tatsuki Fujimoto (藤本 タツキ born October 10, 1993) is a
              currently active mangaka best known for Fire Punch and Chainsaw
              Man. Fujimoto's works are noted for referencing his love of
              movies, a distinctively "scratchy" artstyle with high levels of
              detail, and writing rich worlds with distinctive characters.
              They're also well-known for having a commonality of existential
              dread and nihilistic despair... and yet a surprising amount of
              hope when faced against such overwhelming odds and sadness.
